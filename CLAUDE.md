# CLAUDE.md — working agreement for agents in this repo

Form:at is a PWA for a Glasgow techno collective, live at
[formatglasgow.com](https://formatglasgow.com). The defining constraint: sets
are 90-minute mixes (100–220MB) that must be saveable and playable with no
signal. `README.md` has the engineering narrative; this file is the rules.

| Workspace | Path | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| web | `apps/web` | Public site + audio player → `formatglasgow.com` |
| admin | `apps/admin` | Internal dashboard → `admin.formatglasgow.com`, Cloudflare Access-gated |
| ui | `packages/ui` | Design system — tokens, primitives, Storybook, Chromatic |
| data | `packages/data` | Shared catalogue, D1 queries, push sending |
| rum-archiver | `apps/rum-archiver` | Cron Worker archiving daily RUM rows into D1 → `form-at-rum-archiver` |
| tsconfig | `packages/tsconfig` | Shared TS config, consumed via `workspace:*` |

**Apps never import each other** — only `packages/*` are shared. New apps go in
`apps/`; each picks its own framework, default TanStack Start.

Detail lives in `.claude/rules/*.md`, each scoped by `paths:` so it loads when
you read a file it covers. Procedures live in `.claude/skills/`. `.claude/README.md`
explains the whole setup.

## 1. Hard constraints

One line each. The rule file named after the arrow has the full reasoning; read
it before changing the file a line protects. Every one of these broke silently
at least once.

- **Never claim something is verified without having run it.** If you didn't run
  the command, read the file or see the test pass, say which. Docs here get
  trusted by sessions that can't re-check them.
- **Pass `-a` when grepping fetched HTML**, and grep a known-present string as a
  control: grep suppresses all output on files it classes as binary, and the SSR'd
  HTML qualifies.
- **Purge saved sets on `catalogueConfirmed`, never `catalogueReady`**
  (`apps/web/app/store/offlineSlice.ts`). The only thing here that can silently
  delete user data → `offline-and-service-worker.md`.
- **Never remove or weaken admin's host guard** (`apps/admin/app/utils/hostGuard.ts`,
  enforced in `apps/admin/app/server.ts`). It is the only thing keeping the
  dashboard off `*.pages.dev` → `admin-security-and-metrics.md`.
- **Never apply `apps/web/schema.sql` with `--file` to an existing database.**
  Its `ALTER TABLE`s aren't idempotent; migrate one statement at a time → `data-r2-d1.md`, `/d1-migration`.
- **Never delete `apps/web/app/server.ts` or `apps/admin/app/server.ts`.** Without
  them D1 is unreachable from all server code → `web-app.md`.
- **Never add `self.skipWaiting()` to `apps/web/app/sw.ts`** → `offline-and-service-worker.md`.
- **Never rebuild the `Request` in `sw.ts`'s audio route** — forward the original,
  or seeks lose `Range` → `offline-and-service-worker.md`.
- **Never overwrite an object under `sets/{id}/{version}/` in R2**; build keys with
  `versionedSetKey` (`packages/data/src/r2Keys.ts`) → `data-r2-d1.md`.
- **Every mutating admin endpoint calls `verifyAccessJwt`**
  (`apps/admin/app/utils/verifyAccessJwt.ts`) → `admin-security-and-metrics.md`.
- **Never drop `media-src 'self' blob:` or the R2 `connect-src` from admin's CSP**
  (`apps/admin/app/server.ts`) → `admin-security-and-metrics.md`.
- **Never substitute `0` for a metric that failed to load** — `null` means "couldn't
  read it" → `admin-security-and-metrics.md`.
- **Never remove `@source` from `apps/web/app/styles/global.css`**, or Tailwind
  strips every `packages/ui` class → `design-system-and-styling.md`.
- **Never flatten a `lazy(() => import(...))` into a static import** (`TrendChart`,
  `StoryVideoFlow`, `StoryInstallGate`, `DjStorySheet`) → `stories.md`, `admin-security-and-metrics.md`.
- **Keep every workspace on one `vitest` major** (`^4.1.5`) → `tests.md`.
- **Keep pairs in step:** `WIDTHS` in `optimize-images.ts` ↔ `Image.tsx`;
  `tokens.css` ↔ `tokens.ts` → `design-system-and-styling.md`.
- **Never make `apps/web/vitest.config.ts` extend `vite.config.ts`** → `tests.md`.
- **Never let `ci.yml` and `deploy.yml` share a Playwright cache key** → `ci.md`.
- **Never hand-roll a `[ label ]` bracket button** — `<Button variant="secondary">`
  or `BracketLabel` → `design-system-and-styling.md`.

Hooks in `.claude/hooks/` back up several of these; they warn, they don't replace
reading the rule.

## 2. Workflow

### Git
You commit, push and open the PR; the repo owner reviews and squash-merges.

- **Branch** from an up-to-date `origin/main`, named `feat/…`, `fix/…` or `chore/…`.
  Never commit on `main`; a push to `main` deploys.
- **Authorship is the repo owner's git config.** Never pass `--author`, `-c user.*`
  or change `git config`. No `Co-Authored-By`, no "Generated with", no Claude or
  AI attribution anywhere: commit, PR body, code comments.
- **Stage by name** (`git add <path>`). Never `git add -A`, `--all` or `.`. Never
  touch, stage or delete files that aren't part of the task, untracked ones
  included; report strays instead.
- **Never** `git stash`, `commit --amend`, force-push, `reset --hard`, or rewrite
  history. Two branches at once → `git worktree`, not stash.
- **Never merge** (`gh pr merge`). Before building on something said to be merged,
  check `gh pr view`.
- Commit messages: short, lowercase, imperative ("add …", "fix …").
- `/handoff` runs the checks and writes the summary; `/ship-pr` pushes and opens
  the PR. Visual work waits for approved renders (`/visual-review`) first.

**Cloudflare resources** (Pages, D1, R2, Access, secrets) are provisioned by the
repo owner. Read-only wrangler is fine; anything that writes is theirs to run.

### Before handing off
```bash
pnpm check      # Biome lint + format, then turbo tsc across all workspaces
pnpm test       # unit tests, all workspaces
```
Add `pnpm knip` when exports or dependencies changed. `pnpm test:e2e` and
`pnpm build` take minutes: run them when the change touches routes, the player,
the service worker or CI, and ask first. Report failures with output, and say
plainly which checks you didn't run.

### Edit with the edit tools
Edits through the file tools render as a reviewable diff; `sed`/heredoc edits
don't. Use a shell one-liner only for a genuinely mechanical change across many
files, and say so.

### Leave the docs true
Before handing off, re-read every doc the change could have made false or
incomplete, and fix it. The test is "does an existing doc now say something
untrue?", not "did I add a feature?". "No doc changes needed" is a fine answer
when it follows from that check. The doc-by-doc triggers are in
`.claude/skills/handoff/docs-table.md`. Adding a workspace or script has extra
steps: `/new-workspace`.

---

## 3. Code standards (everywhere)

- **Comments state present-tense facts** about the code — no PR numbers, dates,
  internal labels or history; English only. Full register → `comments.md`.
- **No literal non-breaking or invisible characters in source**; write the escape
  (` `).
- TypeScript strict; no `any` except the documented Cloudflare env cast →
  `react-and-typescript.md`.
- **Biome only** — no Prettier, no ESLint.
- **Simplest implementation that does the job well.** No abstraction before a
  second caller; but two half-built abstractions side by side is debt.
- Tailwind utilities only; tokens in `packages/ui/src/tokens.css` →
  `design-system-and-styling.md`.

## 4. Where things live

| Area | Edit here | Rule |
|---|---|---|
| Audio player | `apps/web/app/hooks/useAudioPlayer.ts` (`Player.tsx` is layout only) | `web-app.md` |
| Offline audio + SW | `apps/web/app/data/offline-audio.ts`, `store/offlineSlice.ts`, `app/sw.ts`, `vite.config.ts` | `offline-and-service-worker.md` |
| Web/app divide, nav, analytics, beacon, store | `apps/web/app/utils/appContext.ts`, `components/SwipeNavigator.tsx`, `routes/api/signal.ts`, `utils/rootHead.ts`, `store/` | `web-app.md` |
| Catalogue, upload keys, peaks, push, RUM archive | `packages/data/src/`, `apps/web/scripts/`, `apps/rum-archiver/` | `data-r2-d1.md` |
| Admin dashboard, auth, metrics | `apps/admin/app/` | `admin-security-and-metrics.md` |
| Design system | `packages/ui/src/` — one folder per component | `design-system-and-styling.md` |
| Instagram Story video, DJ Story image | `apps/web/app/utils/{storyVideo,djStory}/`, `components/{story,djStory}/` | `stories.md` |
| Tests | `apps/*/tests/`, `packages/ui/src/**/*.test.tsx` | `tests.md` |
| CI/CD | `.github/workflows/` | `ci.md` |

## 5. Commands

```bash
pnpm install                      # all workspaces
pnpm dev                          # both apps — web :5173, admin :5174
pnpm dev:web / dev:admin          # one app
pnpm build / build:web / build:admin
pnpm start / start:web / start:admin   # serve production build — web :4173, admin :4174
pnpm test                         # unit, all workspaces
pnpm test:web / test:admin / test:design-system
pnpm test:e2e / test:e2e:web / test:e2e:admin
pnpm check                        # Biome (whole repo) then turbo tsc
pnpm lint / pnpm tsc / pnpm knip
pnpm storybook                    # packages/ui Storybook, :6006
pnpm dump-diff                    # branch diff → .diff-dump/, split by area (misses untracked files)
```

Everything except `check`/`format`/`knip` is a thin Turbo wrapper; `:web`/`:admin`
add a `--filter`. A workspace's own scripts: `pnpm -C apps/web <script>`.
`apps/web/scripts/README.md` documents every script and flag there;
`generate-sets-snapshot`, `optimize-images`, `og` and `sitemap` run inside
`pnpm build`, which is why a root build needs Cloudflare credentials and `pnpm dev`
doesn't. Others: `pnpm -C apps/admin diagnose-visits`, `apps/rum-archiver`'s
`deploy`/`capture`.

**Service-worker behaviour is testable only against a production build**
(`pnpm build:web && pnpm start:web`, :4173); the dev server registers no SW.
`pnpm dev` generates the gitignored `apps/web/app/routeTree.gen.ts`.
