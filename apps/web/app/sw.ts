// Form:at service worker: precaches the app shell, serves saved audio from IDB,
// replays queued analytics beacons, and handles push.
//
// No PWA framework builds this — `vite-plugin-pwa` is not a dependency, only
// the `workbox-*` runtime libraries are. The `buildServiceWorker` plugin in
// `apps/web/vite.config.ts` esbuilds this file to `dist/client/sw.js` as an
// iife and substitutes `self.__WB_MANIFEST` via esbuild `define`. That plugin
// owns which files are precached (an explicit allowlist) and how each entry's
// revision is derived — read it there rather than assuming glob semantics.
//
// Types come from `ServiceWorkerGlobalScope` via `lib: ["WebWorker"]` in
// `tsconfig.sw.json`. `Window` types are intentionally absent, so DOM access
// fails at typecheck rather than at runtime.

// Take control of open clients when this SW activates. This STAYS: on first
// install there is no previous worker and no old client running hashed chunks,
// so claiming immediately is safe — it's what makes offline capability live
// without a reload on the very first visit. For an update it's inert by
// construction: a waiting worker only activates once every client of the old
// worker is gone, so there is nothing stale left to claim by then.
clientsClaim();

// NO `self.skipWaiting()` anywhere — never add one, and never add a message
// handler that calls it on the page's behalf. An immediately-activating SW
// prunes the previous build's hashed chunks from the precache while old
// clients are still running them, and the old client's next lazy route-load
// then 404s, because Cloudflare Pages serves only the latest deployment. A
// broken route, not merely a stale cache.
//
// A new build sits in `waiting` and takes over on the next cold start — the
// lifecycle's own default. There is deliberately no update prompt and no
// forced reload: a reload mid-playback cuts off a 90-minute set, and that is
// the failure this design exists to prevent. Accepted cost: a client left
// open indefinitely keeps running the old version, and a plain reload does
// NOT dislodge it (the document overlap means the registration never drops to
// zero clients) — fully closing the app, or a desktop hard reload, is what
// activates the new build. See PWA_PROGRESS.md's "SW update flow" section.

// Precache everything the build tags into the manifest (HTML, JS, CSS,
// fonts, the icons referenced by the manifest). Workbox handles cache
// versioning by URL revision — old entries are pruned on activate, so we
// don't leak storage across builds.

// Navigation requests (SSR'd HTML): serve from cache instantly, revalidate
// in the background. Form:at's content is stable enough that "one visit
// behind" on a new set is fine, and instant loads beat fresh-on-every-nav.
// SSR semantics are preserved — these are still server-rendered docs, just
// possibly from one visit ago. Cache populates per-URL on first online visit.

// Artwork: same-origin `/images/*` — serve from cache instantly, revalidate

// stays stable across deploys even if we re-export), so SWR lets us pick up
// new exports on the next visit without breaking offline access in the
// meantime. Cache `artwork-v1` survives deploys — artwork rarely changes and
// a stale-for-one-visit image is fine, none of the JS-version-coupling that
// motivated `pages-v1`'s activate-clear applies here.
//
// Bounds: deliberately unbounded — see TECH_DEBT.md item 8. Worst case is
// ~40MB (50 sets × 4 variants × ~200KB), well within per-origin quota.
// Browser pruning under storage pressure is acceptable until observed.

// TanStack Start server-function calls (`/_serverFn/*`): SWR so previously-
// visited route loader data survives offline. Without this, client-side
// click-nav offline rejects the loader (`fetch` fails with
// `ERR_INTERNET_DISCONNECTED`) and the route hits the error boundary —
// even though direct reloads work fine via `pages-v1`.
//
// GET only: caching a POST response would be incorrect (mutation semantics) and
// Workbox refuses non-GET by default anyway. Offline `/api/signal` POSTs are
// handled by the beacon queue instead (TECH_DEBT 4, `~/data/beacon-queue.ts`).
//
// NOT cleared on activate, opposite of `pages-v1`: cached HTML can reference
// purged hashed JS chunks, which is a hydration risk, but `_serverFn` data is
// small JSON with no asset coupling. Wiping it every deploy would erase offline
// access to recently-visited pages, and URLs carry build hashes so stale
// entries go inert on their own. Same reasoning as `audio-v1`/`artwork-v1`:
// stable URL → don't clear.

// Audio: cross-origin R2 MP3 + peaks JSON — read-only from IDB (`audio-v1`
// database). Pass through to network on miss; the download flow in
// `offlineSlice.startDownload` is the only writer. Auto-caching is
// deliberately absent — `save_for_offline` must be an explicit user action,
// not a playback side effect.
//
// IDB rather than Cache Storage — see `~/data/offline-audio.ts` for why. The
// synthetic Response built below satisfies the same Range-slicing contract
// regardless of storage location.
//
// Range handling: `<audio>` issues `Range: bytes=N-` for seek and for
// incremental playback. Only call `createPartialResponse` when a Range header is
// actually present — without one it throws, and the catch returns a misleading
// 416.
//
// === Tab vs app display-mode gate ===
// The page tags playback URLs with `?ctx=app` via `withAppContext` ONLY in
// standalone display-mode, and that marker is the SW's single source of truth
// for "is the requester a standalone PWA?":
//   - missing marker (browser tab) → pure pass-through, never reads IDB. A
//     downloaded set in a tab still streams from R2.
//   - `ctx=app` (standalone) → read IDB, fall through to network on miss.
// The marker is stripped ONLY for the IDB key (`stripAppContext`) so the lookup
// matches the bare URL the download flow stored.
//
// === Network pass-through: ALWAYS `fetch(request)`, never a rebuilt Request ===
// Both pass-through paths (tab, and standalone IDB-miss) must forward the
// ORIGINAL request object. Rebuilding it breaks playback two separate ways:
//   1. `new Request(url, { method, headers })` defaults `mode` to "cors",
//      flipping `<audio>`'s native no-cors so the browser blocks R2 MP3
//      responses. Forwarding `request` preserves mode/credentials/redirect by
//      construction.
//   2. Even a rebuild that copies mode explicitly LOSES the `Range` header: per
//      the Fetch spec a Headers object under the "request-no-cors" guard
//      silently drops anything not no-CORS-safelisted, and Range isn't. Seeks
//      then get a 200 full-body instead of 206, re-downloading 100MB+ sets from
//      byte 0. Node's undici doesn't implement the guard, so this is only
//      observable in a real browser — see PWA_PROGRESS.md's 206-on-seek check.
// The `?ctx=app` marker does reach R2 on the standalone IDB-miss path. That's
// harmless (R2 resolves by path; Range GETs still return 206) and costs only a
// duplicate browser-cache entry keyed separately from the bare tab URL.
//
// === Cached-Response contract ===
// The synthetic Response built here MUST have these five properties or Range
// slicing breaks silently:
//   status:         200  (NOT 206 — slicing a partial response would fail)
//   body:           full blob from IDB
//   Content-Type:   from `entry.contentType` ("audio/mpeg" / "application/json")
//   Content-Length: String(entry.bytesTotal)  (explicit, not the upstream header)
//   Accept-Ranges:  "bytes"

// guards the null case, so this wraps the whole read in try/catch and falls
// back to a generic notification rather than dropping the push silently.
// `buildNotificationOptions` (pure, unit-tested — see

// `event.action` distinguishes a body tap from one of the two action buttons:
