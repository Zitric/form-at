// Form:at service worker — Phase 1 (installable).
//
// Single responsibility right now: precache the app shell and activate
// immediately. That's what makes Lighthouse's "registers a service worker"
// check pass and unlocks Chrome / Android's install prompt — the rest of the
// PWA capabilities (audio caching, beacon queue, update toast) are built on
// top of this minimum viable SW in later phases.
//
// Built with vite-plugin-pwa's `injectManifest` strategy: the plugin replaces
// `self.__WB_MANIFEST` at build time with the precache manifest (every emitted
// asset that matches `injectManifest.globPatterns` in vite.config.ts).
//
// Type context: `ServiceWorkerGlobalScope` from `lib: ["WebWorker"]` in
// `tsconfig.sw.json` — `Window` types are intentionally absent because the SW
// can't touch the DOM and we'd rather fail at typecheck than at runtime.

// Take control of any open clients as soon as this SW activates. Without
// this, clients keep talking to the previous SW until they're closed and
// reopened — which would defeat the "new build · tap to reload" flow we wire
// in Phase 4.2.
clientsClaim();

// Activate this SW the moment it finishes installing, instead of waiting for
// the old SW's clients to close. Pairs with `clientsClaim` above so updates
// land immediately. We can revisit this if we ever ship a breaking
// SW-protocol change and need a controlled rollout, but for an audio app
// where the worst case is "old cache served for 30 more seconds", immediate
// activation is the right default.
self.skipWaiting();

// Precache everything the build tags into the manifest (HTML, JS, CSS,
// fonts, the icons referenced by the manifest). Workbox handles cache
// versioning by URL revision — old entries are pruned on activate, so we
// don't leak storage across builds.

// Navigation requests (SSR'd HTML): serve from cache instantly, revalidate
// in the background. Form:at's content is stable enough that "one visit
// behind" on a new set is fine, and instant loads beat fresh-on-every-nav.
// SSR semantics are preserved — these are still server-rendered docs, just
// possibly from one visit ago. Cache populates per-URL on first online visit.

// Cross-deploy safety: clear the navigation cache on activate so we never
// serve cached HTML referencing hashed JS chunks the new deploy no longer
// ships. Without this, the first post-deploy visit would fetch JS 404s and
// fail to hydrate. The precache itself is versioned by Workbox so only
// `pages-v1` needs explicit clearing.
self.addEventListener("activate", (event) => {
  event.waitUntil(caches.delete("pages-v1"));
});

// Last-resort fallback when nothing else handled the request — no cached
// entry AND network failed. Use `matchPrecache` instead of
// `createHandlerBoundToURL`: the latter runs the PrecacheStrategy which has
// `fallbackToNetwork: true` by default, so a cache miss triggers a network
// fetch that fails offline — defeating the whole point of an offline
// fallback. `matchPrecache` is a direct cache lookup, no network involved.
