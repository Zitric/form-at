-- 2026-07-08: was the play served from IDB (standalone app, set saved
-- offline) or streamed from the network? Populated from the exact same
-- signal the SW audio route uses to decide IDB-vs-network (see
-- `wasServedFromIdb` in `app/store/playerSlice.ts` + the routing comment in
-- `app/sw.ts`) — a saved set in the standalone app is served from IDB
-- regardless of connectivity, so this is "served from cache", not literally
-- "device was offline"; named `is_offline` to match the product framing.
-- NULL for existing rows and for any pre-2026-07-08 cached client still
-- posting the old payload shape during a deploy rollout window (nullable by
-- design — no backfill attempted).
--
-- ⚠️ ONE-TIME MANUAL MIGRATION — NOT idempotent, unlike every other
-- statement in this file. Originally written as `ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS`
-- on the (incorrect, 2026-07-15-disproven) assumption that D1 supports that
-- clause the way vanilla SQLite ≥3.35 does — it doesn't: running the
-- IF-NOT-EXISTS form against remote D1 fails with
-- `near "EXISTS": syntax error at offset 923: SQLITE_ERROR` every time,
-- confirmed via `wrangler d1 execute --remote --file=schema.sql`. The bare
-- form below is Cloudflare's documented-safe D1 pattern and was verified
-- working via `wrangler d1 execute --remote --command`
-- (`PRAGMA table_info(plays)` confirmed `is_offline` present afterward) —
-- but running it AGAIN on a database that already has the column will fail
-- with a duplicate-column error, since there's no IF-NOT-EXISTS guard
-- anymore. Already applied to production as of 2026-07-15; do not re-run
-- this line via `--file` against that database. A fresh/dev database still
-- needs it run once.
ALTER TABLE plays ADD COLUMN is_offline INTEGER;

-- Client-generated id (crypto.randomUUID(), see useAudioPlayer.ts) shared by
-- every segment beacon within one continuous engagement with a track — set
-- once when a track loads, unchanged across pause/resume of that same
-- track, and regenerated on the next track load (including returning to a
-- track played earlier). Exists because `plays` has one row per ≥3s
-- LISTENING SEGMENT (sendPlay fires on pause/track-change/unload), not one
-- row per play: a listener who pauses three times during one set produces
-- four rows for one real play. `COUNT(*)` over this table therefore counts
-- segments, not plays, and inflates visibly at normal pause/resume
-- behaviour — found 2026-08-20.
--
-- The correct count is `COUNT(DISTINCT COALESCE(session_id, 'legacy-' ||
-- id))` — see the "Useful queries" block below. NULL session_id (every row
-- from before this column existed, plus any row from a stale cached client
-- mid-rollout, plus anything that fails validation) falls back via `id`
-- (the table's own autoincrement PK, globally unique) to counting itself as
-- its own singleton session — exactly today's behaviour, continued, not a
-- new number invented for old data. No cutover discontinuity: the same
-- formula applies to every row and becomes exactly correct the moment a
-- row carries a real session_id. Never collapse this back to bare
-- `COUNT(*)` — that silently reintroduces the segment-inflation bug this
-- column exists to fix.
--
-- ⚠️ ONE-TIME MANUAL MIGRATION — same non-idempotent D1 limitation as
-- `is_offline` above (line 25: no `ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS` support).
-- Run BEFORE deploying code that inserts into this column, not after — the
-- INSERT in api/signal.ts names this column explicitly, and a D1 "no such
-- column" error there is caught by that handler's blanket try/catch (it
-- always returns 204), so every play would be silently dropped — not
-- miscounted, not recorded at all — for the whole gap between deploying
-- and running this migration.

-- Aggregate/anonymous first-party event tracking (Phase "Analytics 1",
-- 2026-07-08). Cloudflare Web Analytics stays as-is for page-view metrics;
-- this table is for discrete product events (install funnel, save/share
-- clicks, app launches) that CF Analytics has no concept of.
--
-- STRUCTURAL CONSTRAINT — read before adding a column: no persistent
-- device/session/user identifier of ANY kind. Each row must remain a
-- standalone fact with no reliable way to link it to another row from the
-- same visitor. Concretely:
--   - `id` is a DB-internal autoincrement PK (row order, not identity) and
--     is never returned to any client.
--   - `event_type` / `set_id` / `is_standalone` / `created_at` are all
--     low-cardinality or high-collision dimensions shared across many
--     visitors — none of them, alone or combined, reconstructs a single
--     visitor's session across two rows.
--   - No IP, no User-Agent string, no cookie ID, no fingerprint hash, no
--     `country` (unlike `plays` — deliberately omitted here; adding it
--     needs its own decision, not a silent copy from the plays table).
-- The real enforcement of this decision is at the endpoint
-- (`app/routes/api/event.ts` rejects anything not on the explicit
-- `event_type` allowlist) and in `PWA_PROGRESS.md`'s tracking-design
-- section — this comment exists so a future schema change can't drift past
-- it without the person making the change seeing why the table looks like
-- this. See PWA_PROGRESS.md for the full rationale.
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS events (
  id            INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
  event_type    TEXT    NOT NULL,
  set_id        TEXT,
  is_standalone INTEGER NOT NULL,
  created_at    INTEGER NOT NULL  -- unix ms
);

-- Composite (not two single-column indexes like `plays` uses) because the
-- primary query shape is "this event_type, this date range" together — the
-- leftmost column (event_type) also serves "all events of this type"
-- queries alone via the standard leftmost-prefix rule, so a separate
-- single-column event_type index would be redundant.
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_events_type_created_at ON events (event_type, created_at);
-- Separate single-column index for "everything in a date range regardless
-- of type" queries (mirrors `idx_plays_started_at`'s role for `plays`).
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_events_created_at ON events (created_at);
-- No `set_id` index: only 2 of the 6 current event_types carry one, and
-- there's no known query needing "all save_clicks for set X" yet. Add one
-- if/when that report becomes real — premature otherwise.

-- Useful queries:
--
-- Play counts per set — COUNT(DISTINCT ...) dedupes the listening-segment
-- rows sendPlay writes on every pause/track-change/unload back down to real
-- plays (see session_id's own comment above). avg_secs stays a per-segment
-- average deliberately — "how long a segment lasts before a pause" is a
-- different, still-useful number from "how long a play lasts", and turning
-- it into the latter needs summing per-session first, not asked for here:
--   SELECT set_title, set_artist,
--          COUNT(DISTINCT COALESCE(session_id, 'legacy-' || id)) AS plays,
--          ROUND(AVG(listened_seconds)) AS avg_secs
--   FROM plays GROUP BY set_id ORDER BY plays DESC;
--
-- Listeners by country:
--   SELECT country, COUNT(DISTINCT COALESCE(session_id, 'legacy-' || id)) AS plays
--   FROM plays GROUP BY country ORDER BY plays DESC;
--
-- Plays by day:
--   SELECT DATE(started_at / 1000, 'unixepoch') AS day,
--          COUNT(DISTINCT COALESCE(session_id, 'legacy-' || id)) AS plays
--   FROM plays GROUP BY day ORDER BY day DESC;
--
-- Offline vs network SEGMENTS (NULL = pre-is_offline rows, exclude from the
-- ratio). Deliberately COUNT(*), not deduped by session: this measures
-- volume of listening activity by delivery mode, not distinct plays, and a
-- session that crosses connectivity states has no single correct bucket to
-- collapse into:
--   SELECT is_offline, COUNT(*) AS segments FROM plays
--   WHERE is_offline IS NOT NULL GROUP BY is_offline;
--
-- Install funnel (shown → accepted / dismissed), last 30 days:
--   SELECT event_type, COUNT(*) AS n FROM events
--   WHERE event_type IN ('install_prompt_shown', 'install_accepted', 'install_dismissed')
--     AND created_at > (unixepoch('now') * 1000 - 30 * 86400000)
--   GROUP BY event_type;
--
-- App launches (standalone) by day:
--   SELECT DATE(created_at / 1000, 'unixepoch') AS day, COUNT(*) AS launches
--   FROM events WHERE event_type = 'app_launch' GROUP BY day ORDER BY day DESC;
--
-- Save-clicks per set:
--   SELECT set_id, COUNT(*) AS clicks FROM events
--   WHERE event_type = 'save_click' GROUP BY set_id ORDER BY clicks DESC;

-- Push notification subscriptions (Phase 2, 2026-07-15).
--
-- ⚠️ DELIBERATE EXCEPTION to the "no persistent identifier" rule that
-- governs `events` (see that table's comment block above). Read this before
-- assuming the same anonymous-aggregate philosophy applies here — it does
-- NOT, and that's by necessity, not an oversight or a quiet reversal of the
-- Analytics 1 decision:
--   - `events` rows are disconnected FACTS about aggregate behavior — no
--     row needs to be addressable, and addressability was explicitly
--     designed out.
--   - A push subscription's `endpoint` IS, unavoidably, an addressable
--     per-device token — that's the ENTIRE mechanism by which push
--     delivery works. The push service (FCM, Mozilla autopush, etc.) uses
--     that exact URL to route a message to one specific browser
--     installation. There is no way to implement Web Push without storing
--     something that identifies an individual subscriber's endpoint; the
--     capability and the "traceable to a device" property are the same
--     fact, not separable design choices.
-- The mitigation is scope, not anonymity: this table is NEVER joined
-- against `events` or `plays` (nothing here would even join cleanly — no
-- shared key), it stores NOTHING beyond what push delivery strictly
-- requires (no IP, no UA, no name/email — `is_standalone` is the only
-- "extra" field, kept purely to distinguish install-prompted vs. tab
-- subscribers in aggregate counts, never to identify one row). If this
-- table is ever queried for anything beyond "who do I send this
-- announcement to," that's a new decision requiring the same scrutiny the
-- `events` table's design got — it doesn't inherit a blanket allowance.

-- No secondary index: the only query this table serves today is "give me

-- and deletes are by the primary key (`endpoint`) directly on a 404/410
-- cleanup. Add one if a real filtered-send use case shows up later.

-- Useful queries:
--
-- All subscriptions (what the send script reads):
--   SELECT endpoint, p256dh, auth FROM push_subscriptions;
--

--   SELECT is_standalone, COUNT(*) AS n FROM push_subscriptions GROUP BY is_standalone;

--   DELETE FROM push_subscriptions WHERE endpoint = ?;

-- Admin-only: one row per push notification sent from apps/admin's
-- notifications page (Phase D1, 2026-08-01 — the first mutating admin
-- feature). Exists so a recent-sends list can be shown on that page,
-- surfacing an accidental duplicate send (three people have Cloudflare
-- Access; nothing stops two of them sending the same announcement minutes
-- apart, or a page refresh re-submitting) BEFORE it happens again, not
-- just after. `sent_by_email` is the Cloudflare Access identity's verified
-- email (apps/admin/app/utils/verifyAccessJwt.ts) — never trust a
-- client-supplied value for this field. apps/web's own scripts/send-push.ts
-- (the CLI fallback, still available) does not write to this table — it
-- has no D1 binding to write through and remains a local-only operator tool.
--
-- Applied to the remote database — the admin send path awaits
-- `recordPushSend`, so a missing table would fail every send. The `PRAGMA`
-- below is the authority if you need to confirm; don't trust this line alone,
-- it records a state that changes. Re-running the CREATE is harmless either

-- migrated in below with their EXACT current ids, so every existing `plays`/
-- `events` row (keyed by a plain `set_id` string, decoupled from where the
-- MusicSet record itself lives) keeps working unchanged. No split-brain
-- catalogue: this is the one source of truth, not a second copy alongside
-- the static array.
--
-- Nothing reads from or writes to this table yet — that's later PRs
-- (packages/data/src/sets.ts gaining D1-aware query functions, the public
-- /sets and /sets/$id loaders switching to them, and finally the admin
-- upload UI that writes new rows). This PR is pure groundwork: the table
-- exists and the 4 legacy sets are in it, verified to match the static
-- array field-for-field, with nothing else changed.
--
-- `artwork` mirrors the existing bare-path convention (`Image` resolves it
-- to `/images/{artwork}-{width}.{ext}`) for both legacy and future uploaded
-- sets alike. `artwork_original_url` is upload-only (the as-uploaded R2
-- original, used as the always-available fallback until a build generates
-- optimized variants for it — see the upload feature's design notes).
-- `peaks_status` defaults to 'ready' since the upload flow (Option 1: admin
-- runs the existing scripts/generate-peaks.mjs locally and uploads the
-- result) never leaves a set in a pending state — the column exists now so
-- a possible future automated-peaks-generation phase doesn't need a second
-- migration.
--
-- `created_at` (unix ms) is upload/migration recency, NOT the user-entered
-- `date` field — sorting DESC on it is what makes a newly uploaded set
-- "appear at the top of the list". The 4 legacy rows below get 4 DISTINCT
-- values one second apart (not the same migration timestamp) specifically
-- so DESC ordering is deterministic — SQLite gives no guaranteed order
-- among ties, and four rows inserted with an identical timestamp could
-- reorder between requests.

ALTER TABLE admin_deleted_sets ADD COLUMN restored_at INTEGER;

-- No secondary index — this table only ever serves "most recent N deletions"
-- (the admin sets page's recently-deleted list) or a full scan when actually
-- recovering a specific set.

-- Useful queries:
--
-- Recently deleted sets not yet restored (what the admin sets page shows):
--   SELECT id, deleted_at, deleted_by_email, set_id, title, artist, play_count_at_deletion
--   FROM admin_deleted_sets WHERE restored_at IS NULL ORDER BY deleted_at DESC LIMIT 10;
--
-- Restore a deleted set (the one-click admin action does exactly this —
-- INSERT the log row's stored columns back into `sets`, then mark this log
-- entry restored — see routes/api/sets/restore.ts's restoreSetFromLog):
--   SELECT * FROM admin_deleted_sets WHERE id = ? AND restored_at IS NULL;

-- Archived daily Web Analytics (RUM) rows — IMPROVEMENTS.md #12.
--
-- WHY THIS EXISTS: Cloudflare keeps beacon data unsampled for 7 days, then
-- aggregates it to around 10% and eventually drops it. Measured on this site:
-- a 60-day query returned 120 visits extrapolated from 12 real observations,
-- with only 11 of 55 days carrying rows at all — sampling deletes whole days,
-- not just precision. Capturing each day while it is still inside the
-- unsampled window is therefore the ONLY way to hold accurate history past a
-- week. Same shape as the sets snapshot: a stored copy of something
-- authoritative elsewhere, kept because the source degrades.
--
-- RAW, NOT FILTERED: bot rows are stored too (`is_bot`), not dropped at
-- capture. The bot share is itself displayed, filtering would discard
-- information irreversibly for a saving of ~1 row/day, and if the bot
-- classification ever changes the raw rows can be re-derived.
--
-- `sample_interval` is the field that makes a late capture detectable: 1 means
-- the row was captured inside the unsampled window and is exact; above 1 means
-- it was already degraded when archived. Stored per row so the reader can
-- prove provenance instead of assuming it, and so the upsert below can refuse
-- to overwrite good data with bad.
--
-- Applied to the remote database. Do NOT use `--file=apps/web/schema.sql`
-- (this file also contains the one-time, non-idempotent `ALTER TABLE plays ADD
-- COLUMN is_offline` above — running the whole file fails with a
-- duplicate-column error). The isolated statement that created it:
-- npx wrangler d1 execute form-at-analytics --remote --command "CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS rum_daily (day TEXT NOT NULL, is_bot INTEGER NOT NULL, page_loads INTEGER NOT NULL, visits INTEGER NOT NULL, sample_size INTEGER, sample_interval REAL NOT NULL, captured_at INTEGER NOT NULL, PRIMARY KEY (day, is_bot))"
-- Verify it landed:
-- npx wrangler d1 execute form-at-analytics --remote --command "PRAGMA table_info(rum_daily)"
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS rum_daily (
  day             TEXT    NOT NULL,  -- YYYY-MM-DD (UTC), Cloudflare's `date` dimension
  is_bot          INTEGER NOT NULL,  -- 0/1, Cloudflare's `bot` dimension
  page_loads      INTEGER NOT NULL,  -- the RUM `count` field
  visits          INTEGER NOT NULL,  -- confidence.sum.visits.estimate
  sample_size     INTEGER,           -- raw samples behind the estimate; NULL when absent
  sample_interval REAL    NOT NULL,  -- 1 = exact; >1 = archived after degrading
  captured_at     INTEGER NOT NULL,  -- unix ms — feeds the staleness disclosure
  -- Composite key, so re-running a capture for a day replaces exactly its own
  -- rows and nothing else. This is what makes the upsert idempotent.
  PRIMARY KEY (day, is_bot)
);

-- THE UPSERT, and the guard that is the whole point of storing
-- `sample_interval`. A run that fires late re-fetches days that have already
-- aged past 7 and come back SAMPLED. Without the WHERE clause, that late run
-- would overwrite exact rows with extrapolated ones — silently destroying the
-- very data the archive exists to preserve, irreversibly, and invisibly until
-- someone compared numbers months later. Never remove it:
--
--   INSERT INTO rum_daily (day, is_bot, page_loads, visits, sample_size, sample_interval, captured_at)
--   VALUES (?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?)
--   ON CONFLICT(day, is_bot) DO UPDATE SET
--     page_loads      = excluded.page_loads,
--     visits          = excluded.visits,
--     sample_size     = excluded.sample_size,
--     sample_interval = excluded.sample_interval,
--     captured_at     = excluded.captured_at
--   WHERE excluded.sample_interval <= rum_daily.sample_interval;
--
-- Useful queries:
--
-- Daily human visits, newest first (what the history card reads):
--   SELECT day, visits, page_loads, sample_interval FROM rum_daily
--   WHERE is_bot = 0 ORDER BY day DESC;
--
-- Archive freshness (feeds the staleness warning):
--   SELECT MAX(day) AS newest_day, MAX(captured_at) AS last_capture FROM rum_daily;
--
-- Any rows archived late, i.e. already degraded when captured:
--   SELECT day, sample_interval FROM rum_daily WHERE sample_interval > 1 ORDER BY day;

-- rum_capture_runs — one row per archiver run, successful or not.
--
-- WHY THIS EXISTS, and why coverage cannot be read off `rum_daily`:
-- a day with no row in `rum_daily` is ambiguous. It means either "a capture
-- looked and Cloudflare reported nothing" (a real zero, and real data) or
-- "nobody ever captured this day" (unknown). The history card must not draw
-- those the same way — a zero over an uncaptured stretch renders an outage as
-- flat traffic, which is the one thing this archive exists to make impossible.
--
-- Coverage was originally derived from `SELECT DISTINCT captured_at FROM
-- rum_daily`, which is wrong in a way that only shows up on a quiet week: a run
-- over a window with NO traffic writes no rows, therefore leaves no
-- `captured_at`, and is indistinguishable afterwards from a run that never
-- happened. Seven healthy days rendered as seven "nobody looked" gaps.
-- Coverage has to be recorded by the writer, not inferred by the reader.
--
-- `since`/`until` are stored PER RUN rather than recomputed from `captured_at`
-- and today's `RUM_UNSAMPLED_DAYS`. Changing that constant must not retroactively
-- rewrite what past runs are claimed to have observed.
--
-- `ok` distinguishes the two failure modes that need different fixes:
--   ok = 1  the read succeeded — these windows, and only these, are coverage.
--   ok = 0  the cron fired but the read failed. NOT coverage (we didn't see
--           those days), but proof the trigger is alive. A cron that fires
--           daily and fails every time must not read as fresh, and a quiet week
--           must not read as a stopped cron; the card needs both signals
--           separately, which is the whole reason failures are logged at all.
--
-- Applied with:
-- npx wrangler d1 execute form-at-analytics --remote --command "CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS rum_capture_runs (captured_at INTEGER PRIMARY KEY, since TEXT NOT NULL, until TEXT NOT NULL, ok INTEGER NOT NULL, rows_fetched INTEGER NOT NULL, rows_written INTEGER NOT NULL, reason TEXT)"
-- Then backfill from the runs already evidenced by rum_daily, so the card keeps
-- rendering exactly what it renders today and there's no dual-read path:
-- npx wrangler d1 execute form-at-analytics --remote --command "INSERT OR IGNORE INTO rum_capture_runs (captured_at, since, until, ok, rows_fetched, rows_written) SELECT DISTINCT captured_at, date(captured_at/1000, 'unixepoch', '-6 days'), date(captured_at/1000, 'unixepoch'), 1, 0, 0 FROM rum_daily"
-- Verify:
-- npx wrangler d1 execute form-at-analytics --remote --command "SELECT captured_at, since, until, ok FROM rum_capture_runs ORDER BY captured_at DESC LIMIT 10"
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS rum_capture_runs (
  captured_at  INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,  -- unix ms; matches rum_daily.captured_at for the same run
  since        TEXT    NOT NULL,     -- first day of the window this run observed
  until        TEXT    NOT NULL,     -- last day of that window
  ok           INTEGER NOT NULL,     -- 1 = read succeeded (counts as coverage); 0 = it did not
  rows_fetched INTEGER NOT NULL,     -- groups Cloudflare returned; 0 on a genuinely quiet window
