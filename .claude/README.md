# The `.claude/` folder — a guide

This folder configures Claude Code for this repo. It's written for the person
working with Claude here, not for Claude: Claude Code doesn't load this file on
its own (it reads only the files listed under "What loads when" below).
Everything here applies to Claude Code 2.1.280; the docs are at
code.claude.com/docs.

## What loads when

| Piece | Where | Loads |
|---|---|---|
| Project instructions | `CLAUDE.md` (repo root) | At the start of every session, in full. Kept short on purpose. |
| Your private instructions | `CLAUDE.local.md` (repo root, gitignored) | At the start of every session, after `CLAUDE.md`. |
| Your instructions for every project | `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md` | At the start of every session, in every repo. (You don't have one.) |
| Rules | `.claude/rules/*.md` | A rule with a `paths:` list loads the first time Claude reads or edits a matching file; without `paths:` it would load at start. All of ours have `paths:`. |
| Skills | `.claude/skills/<name>/SKILL.md` | Only the one-line `description` at start. The full text loads when you type `/<name>`, or when Claude decides the task matches the description. |
| Subagents | `.claude/agents/*.md` | Never on their own here. A subagent runs in its own context, on its own model, and reports back. |
| Hooks | `.claude/hooks/*.sh`, wired in `settings.json` | Run by Claude Code itself on every matching tool call. Claude can't skip or argue with them. |
| Settings | `.claude/settings.json` (committed), `.claude/settings.local.json` (yours, gitignored) | Read at start and reloaded when they change: permissions, hooks, attribution. |
| MCP servers | `.mcp.json` (repo root) | Connected at start after you approve them once; only their tool names sit in context until a tool is used. |

## A day of work

1. **Explore.** Ask Claude to look around; it reads code and the matching rules load.
2. **Plan.** Shift+Tab until the mode says plan; Claude proposes and edits nothing until you approve.
3. **Code.** Approve the plan; Claude implements on a new `feat/` / `fix/` / `chore/` branch.
4. **`/handoff`.** Checks, docs, commit, change summary (complex parts in English and Spanish).
5. **`/visual-review`** for anything visible: renders land in `~/Downloads/<topic>/`; you approve or ask for changes.
6. **`/ship-pr`.** Push, PR, CI report. You review and squash-merge.

Between features run `/clear`. Inside a long feature run `/compact`. Check what's
using context with `/context`. To get back to a PR's session later:
`claude --from-pr <number>` opens the session picker filtered to sessions linked
to that PR (Claude Code links them when Claude opens the PR).

## "I keep correcting Claude about X. Where does the fix go?"

| If X… | Put it in |
|---|---|
| must never happen, even if Claude forgets | a hook (`hooks/`), plus a test in `hooks/tests/` |
| applies to one area of the code | the rule file for that area, or a new rule with `paths:` |
| is a multi-step procedure you repeat | a skill |
| applies everywhere and fits in one line | `CLAUDE.md` |
| is about you, your machine or your accounts, in this repo | `CLAUDE.local.md` |
| is about you, in every repo | `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md` |

## Adding things

**A rule.** Create `.claude/rules/<topic>.md` and start it with the files it
covers, like `ci.md`:

```markdown
---
paths:
  - ".github/workflows/**"
---

# CI/CD
...
```

**A skill.** Create `.claude/skills/<name>/SKILL.md`. The description is what
Claude reads to decide when to use it. `disable-model-invocation: true` makes it
yours to start only, as in `d1-migration`:

```markdown
---
name: d1-migration
description: Print the one-statement-at-a-time wrangler commands …
disable-model-invocation: true
---
```

**A subagent.** In this version `/agents` only reminds you to ask Claude or
write the file. Ask Claude ("make a read-only subagent that …"), or create
`.claude/agents/<name>.md` like `docs-truth-checker.md`: `name`, `description`,
`tools`, `model`.

**A hook.** Write the script in `.claude/hooks/`, add it under `hooks` in
`settings.json` (copy an existing entry), and add cases to `hooks/tests/`.
`/hooks` shows what's configured; it doesn't edit.

**An MCP server.**
`claude mcp add --scope project --transport http <name> <url>` writes it to
`.mcp.json`; `/mcp` shows status and approval. Keep them read-only toward
Cloudflare.

## When a hook blocks something

The reason appears in the conversation as `PreToolUse:Bash hook error: … guard-bash blocked this command: <reason>`. Claude should change course, not retry. To see
what a hook does with a command, run it by hand:

```bash
echo '{"tool_input":{"command":"git stash list"}}' | bash .claude/hooks/guard-bash.sh; echo "exit $?"
```

Exit 2 = blocked (reason on stderr), exit 0 with JSON = ask, exit 0 and nothing
= allowed. If a hook is wrong, fix the script and add a case to
`hooks/tests/guard-bash.cases`. For an emergency, `"disableAllHooks": true` in
`.claude/settings.local.json` turns all hooks off until you remove it.

## Troubleshooting

- **What instructions loaded?** `/memory` lists the CLAUDE.md files and rules
  in play. `/context` shows what fills the window and how big each piece is.
- **Did my settings load?** `/status` shows the setting sources. `claude doctor`
  lists entries it rejected.
- **Conflicting instructions?** `/doctor prompt-audit`.
- **Is a customization causing it?** `claude --safe-mode` starts with all of
  this off.
- **Test the hooks:** `bash .claude/hooks/tests/run.sh`.
