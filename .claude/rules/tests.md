# Tests

## Never let two workspaces resolve different `vitest` majors

`@testing-library/jest-dom` does **not** depend on `vitest`, so the
`import 'vitest'` carrying its matcher augmentation resolves to whichever single
copy pnpm hoists to `node_modules/.pnpm/node_modules/vitest`. With one version in
the tree that's unambiguous. Add a workspace on a different major and pnpm hoists
one of them — if it picks the other one, jest-dom augments a `vitest` module
nobody type-checks against, and **every** `toBeInTheDocument` / `toHaveClass` /
`toHaveAttribute` in `packages/ui` fails with `TS2339: Property does not exist on
type 'Assertion<HTMLElement>'`.

The failure looks nothing like its cause: the errors land in `packages/ui` test
files that nobody touched, and the hoist can resolve differently on two machines,
so it reproduces in CI while `pnpm -C packages/ui tsc` passes locally. It cost a
full diagnostic pass — versions, lockfile, incremental state, filename casing and
`node_modules` drift all had to be eliminated first. Every workspace is on
`vitest` `^4.1.5`; keep it that way, and if a new workspace genuinely needs
another major, expect this and pin the hoist rather than discovering it in CI.

## Never make `apps/web/vitest.config.ts` extend `vite.config.ts`

It is standalone deliberately: the `tanstackStart` plugin sets up SSR routing
that conflicts with isolated test rendering.

## Layout and conventions

- `apps/web/tests/unit/` — Vitest + jsdom, one folder per concern: `store/`, `hooks/`, `components/`, `utils/`, `data/`, `routes/`, `scripts/`.
- `apps/web/tests/e2e/` — Playwright, four projects (chromium, webkit, mobile-chrome, mobile-safari). Mocks `*.mp3` with a silent fixture.
- `apps/web/tests/setup.ts` — jest-dom matchers + `HTMLMediaElement` stubs (jsdom doesn't decode audio).
- `playwright.config.ts` uses `workers: 1` — Vite's dev server races on parallel route loads.
- Click handlers calling `playTrack` rely on the module-level `audioEl` ref in `playerSlice.ts`; register a fake element with `registerAudioElement()` in `beforeEach`.
- Conventions and how to add one: `apps/web/tests/README.md`.
- `packages/ui/vitest.setup.ts` wires jest-dom and calls `installDialogPolyfill()` — the polyfill itself is `packages/ui/src/domPolyfills.ts` (jsdom implements no `HTMLDialogElement.showModal()`).
- `packages/ui` interaction tests: see the two traps in `design-system-and-styling.md`.
